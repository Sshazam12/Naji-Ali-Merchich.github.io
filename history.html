                <p>The history of chess can be traced back nearly 1500 years to its earliest known predecessor, called
                  chaturanga, in India; its prehistory is the subject of speculation. From India it spread to Persia. Following
                  the Arab invasion and conquest of Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to
                  Spain and the rest of Southern Europe. The game evolved roughly into its current form by about 1500 CE.
                  <br>
                  "Romantic chess" was the predominant playing style from the late 18th century to the 1880s Chess games of this
                  period emphasized quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic planning.[1] The Romantic era of
                  play was followed by the Scientific, Hypermodern, and New Dynamism eras In the second half of the 19th
                  century, modern chess tournament play began, and the first official World Chess Championship was held in 1886.
                  The 20th century saw great leaps forward in chess theory and the establishment of the World Chess Federation.
                  In 1997, an IBM supercomputer beat Garry Kasparov, the then world chess champion, in the famous Deep Blue
                  versus Garry Kasparov match, ushering the game into an era of computer domination. Since then, computer
                  analysis which originated in the 1970s with the first programmed chess games on the market has contributed to
                  much of the development in chess theory and has become an important part of preparation in professional human
                  chess. Later developments in the 21st century made the use of computer analysis far surpassing the ability of
                  any human player accessible to the public. Online gaming, which first appeared in the mid-1990s, also became
                  popular in the 21st century.

        <p>Precursors to chess originated in India. There, its early form in the 7th century CE was known as chaturaṅga
          (Sanskrit: चतुरङ्ग), which translates to "four divisions (of the military)": infantry, cavalry, elephantry,
          and chariotry. These forms are represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight,
          bishop, and rook, respectively.

          Chess was introduced to Persia from India and became a part of the princely or courtly education of Persian
          nobility Around 600 CE in Sassanid Persia, the name for the game became chatrang (Persian: چترنگ), which
          subsequently evolved to shatranj (Arabic: شطرنج; Persian: شترنج) after the conquest of Persia by the Rashidun
          Caliphate, due to the lack of native ch and ng sounds in the Arabic language.The rules were developed further
          during this time; players started calling "Shāh!" (Persian for "King!") when attacking the opponent's king,
          and "Shāh Māt!" (Persian for "the king is helpless" – see checkmate) when the king was attacked and could not
          escape from attack. These exclamations persisted in chess as it traveled to other lands.

          The game was taken up by the Muslim world after the early Arab Muslims conquered the Sassanid Empire, with the
          pieces largely keeping their Persian names</p>
